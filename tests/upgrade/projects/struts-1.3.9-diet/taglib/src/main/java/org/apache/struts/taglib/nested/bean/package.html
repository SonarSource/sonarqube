The nested bean tags extend the <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.bean</code>
tags to allow them to relate to each other in a nested nature. The fundamental
logic of the <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.bean</code> tags don't change,
except in that all references to beans and bean properties will be managed
in a nested context. <br>
