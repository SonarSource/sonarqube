# This will create alf_data Relative to appserver run folder
# In this default file we take the property from the POM (for compatbility with local jetty and jboss deployments) but it can also be edited here.
dir.root=${alfresco.data.location}
# Allowed values are: NONE, AUTO, FULL

# Fail or not when there are node integrity checker errors
integrity.failOnError=true

# database connection properties
# MySQL connection (This is default and requires mysql-connector-java-5.0.3-bin.jar, which ships with the Alfresco server)

# MySQL dialect
hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLInnoDBDialect




# Change the following values only if you know what you're doing.
# Default should suffice in most cases when running jetty embedded
# for amp testing





# Property to control whether schema updates are performed automatically.
# Updates must be enabled during upgrades as, apart from the static upgrade scripts,
# there are also auto-generated update scripts that will need to be executed.  After
# upgrading to a new version, this can be disabled.
