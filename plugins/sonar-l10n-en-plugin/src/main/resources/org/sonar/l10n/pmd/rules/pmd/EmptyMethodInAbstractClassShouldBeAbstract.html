An empty method in an abstract class should be abstract instead, as developer may rely on this empty implementation rather than code the appropriate one.
  <pre>
public abstract class ShouldBeAbstract
{
  public Object couldBeAbstract()
	{
	// Should be abstract method ?
	  return null;
	}

	public void couldBeAbstract()
	{
	}
}
</pre>
