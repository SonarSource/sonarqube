Swith are designed complex branches, and allow branches to share treatement. Using a switch for only a few branches is ill advised, as switches are not as easy to understand as if. In this case, it's most likely is a good idea to use a if statement instead, at least to increase code readability. Example :
<pre>
// With a minimumNumberCaseForASwitch of 3
public class Foo {
  public void bar() {
    switch (condition) {
      case ONE:
        instruction;
        break;
      default:
        break; // not enough for a 'switch' stmt,
               // a simple 'if' stmt would have been more appropriate
    }
  }
}
</pre>
