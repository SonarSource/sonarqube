Checks for redundant import statements. An import statement is considered redundant if:
<ul>
    <li>It is a duplicate of another import. This is, when a class is imported more than once.</li>
    <li>The class imported is from the java.lang package, e.g. importing java.lang.String.</li>
    <li>The class imported is from the same package.</li></ul>
