If the abstract class does not provides any methods, it may be just a data container that is not to be instantiated. In this case, it's probably better to use a private or a protected constructor in order to prevent instantiation than make the class misleadingly abstract. Example :
<pre>
public class abstract Example {
	String field;
	int otherField;
}
</pre>
