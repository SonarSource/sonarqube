<BODY>
<p>
This package contains implementations of the
{@link java.util.List List} interface.
</p>
<p>
The following implementations are provided in the package:
<ul>
<li>TreeList - a list that is optimised for insertions and removals at any index in the list</li>
<li>CursorableLinkedList - a list that can be modified while the listIterator (cursor) is being used</li>
<li>NodeCachingLinkedList - a linked list that caches the storage nodes for a performance gain</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The following decorators are provided in the package:
<ul>
<li>Synchronized - synchronizes method access for multi-threaded environments</li>
<li>Unmodifiable - ensures the collection cannot be altered</li>
<li>Predicated - ensures that only elements that are valid according to a predicate can be added</li>
<li>Typed - ensures that only elements that are of a specific type can be added</li>
<li>Transformed - transforms each element added</li>
<li>FixedSize - ensures that the size of the list cannot change</li>
<li>Lazy - creates objects in the list on demand</li>
<li>Growth - grows the list instead of erroring when set/add used with index beyond the list size</li>
<li>SetUnique - a list that avoids duplicate entries like a Set</li>
</ul>
</p>
