A field name is all in uppercase characters, which in Sun's Java naming conventions indicate a constant. However, the field is not final. Example :
<pre>
public class Foo {
  // this is bad, since someone could accidentally
  // do PI = 2.71828; which is actualy e
  // final double PI = 3.16; is ok
  double PI = 3.16;
}
</pre>
