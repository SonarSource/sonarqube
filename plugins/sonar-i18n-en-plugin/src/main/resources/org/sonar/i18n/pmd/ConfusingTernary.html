In an if expression with an else clause, avoid negation in the test. For example, rephrase: if (x != y) diff(); else same(); as: if (x == y) same(); else diff(); Most if (x != y) cases without an else are often return cases, so consistent use of this rule makes the code easier to read. Also, this resolves trivial ordering problems, such as does the error case go first? or does the common case go first?.
