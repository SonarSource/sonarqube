The empty PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file is here to override the one defined in /docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md.

This allows us to not show a template for PRs on the sonarsource/sonar-enterprise repository, while leaving a template for the public sonarsource/sonarqube repository.

Note: do not call this file "README", as it would override the one in the repository root.
