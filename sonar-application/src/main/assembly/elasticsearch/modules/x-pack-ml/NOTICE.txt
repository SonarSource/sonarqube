2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

gcc-runtime LICENSE

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

Alan Beale <biljir@pobox.com> also deserves special credit as he has,
in addition to providing the 12Dicts package and being a major
contributor to the ENABLE word list, given me an incredible amount of
feedback and created a number of special lists (those found in the
Supplement) in order to help improve the overall quality of SCOWL.

The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to
the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most
common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and
frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk's "UK English Wordlist
with Frequency Classification".

The MWords package was explicitly placed in the public domain:

    The Moby lexicon project is complete and has
    been place into the public domain. Use, sell,
    rework, excerpt and use in any way on any platform.

    Placing this material on internal or public servers is
    also encouraged. The compiler is not aware of any
    export restrictions so freely distribute world-wide.

    You can verify the public domain status by contacting

    grady@northcoast.com

The "UK English Wordlist With Frequency Classification" is also in the
Public Domain:

  Date: Sat, 08 Jul 2000 20:27:21 +0100
  From: Brian Kelk <Brian.Kelk@cl.cam.ac.uk>

  > I was wondering what the copyright status of your "UK English
  > Wordlist With Frequency Classification" word list as it seems to
  > be lacking any copyright notice.

  There were many many sources in total, but any text marked
  "copyright" was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one
  source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called
  PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public
  domain.

  Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 19:31:34 +0100

  > So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?

  That is the intention.

The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.

The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at
least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package.  All
words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via
my inflection database.

The 12Dicts package and Supplement is in the Public Domain.

The WordNet database, which was used in the creation of the
Inflections database, is under the following copyright:

  This software and database is being provided to you, the LICENSEE,

The 40 level includes words from Alan's 3esl list found in version 4.0
of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 3esl list is also in the
public domain.

The 50 level includes Brian's frequency class 1, words words appearing
in at least 5 of 12 of the dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts
package, and uppercase words in at least 4 of the previous 12
dictionaries.  A decent number of proper names is also included: The
top 1000 male, female, and Last names from the 1990 Census report; a
list of names sent to me by Alan Beale; and a few names that I added
myself.  Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in
other word lists is included.

The name files form the Census report is a government document which I
don't think can be copyrighted.

The file special-jargon.50 uses common.lst and word.lst from the
"Unofficial Jargon File Word Lists" which is derived from "The Jargon
File".  All of which is in the Public Domain.  This file also contain
a few extra UNIX terms which are found in the file "unix-terms" in the
special/ directory.

The 55 level includes words from Alan's 2of4brif list found in version
4.0 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 2of4brif is also
in the public domain.

The 60 level includes all words appearing in at least 2 of the 12
dictionaries as indicated by the 12Dicts package.

The 70 level includes Brian's frequency class 0 and the 74,550 common
dictionary words from the MWords package.  The common dictionary words,
like those from the 12Dicts package, have had all likely inflections
added.  The 70 level also included the 5desk list from version 4.0 of
the 12Dics package which is the public domain.

The 80 level includes the ENABLE word list, all the lists in the
ENABLE supplement package (except for ABLE), the "UK Advanced Cryptics
Dictionary" (UKACD), the list of signature words in from YAWL package,
and the 10,196 places list from the MWords package.

The ENABLE package, mainted by M\Cooper <thegrendel@theriver.com>,
is in the Public Domain:

  The ENABLE master word list, WORD.LST, is herewith formally released
  into the Public Domain. Anyone is free to use it or distribute it in
  any manner they see fit. No fee or registration is required for its
  use nor are "contributions" solicited (if you feel you absolutely
  must contribute something for your own peace of mind, the authors of
  the ENABLE list ask that you make a donation on their behalf to your
  favorite charity). This word list is our gift to the Scrabble
  community, as an alternate to "official" word lists. Game designers
  may feel free to incorporate the WORD.LST into their games. Please
  mention the source and credit us as originators of the list. Note
  that if you, as a game designer, use the WORD.LST in your product,
  you may still copyright and protect your product, but you may *not*
  legally copyright or in any way restrict redistribution of the
  WORD.LST portion of your product. This *may* under law restrict your
  rights to restrict your users' rights, but that is only fair.

UKACD, by J Ross Beresford <ross@bryson.demon.co.uk>, is under the
following copyright:

  Copyright (c) J Ross Beresford 1993-1999. All Rights Reserved.

  The following restriction is placed on the use of this publication:
  if The UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary is used in a software package
  or redistributed in any form, the copyright notice must be
  prominently displayed and the text of this document must be included
  verbatim.

  There are no other restrictions: I would like to see the list
  distributed as widely as possible.

The 95 level includes the 354,984 single words, 256,772 compound
words, 4,946 female names and the 3,897 male names, and 21,986 names
from the MWords package, ABLE.LST from the ENABLE Supplement, and some
additional words found in my part-of-speech database that were not
found anywhere else.

Accent information was taken from UKACD.

My VARCON package was used to create the American, British, and
Canadian word list.

Since the original word lists used used in the VARCON package came
from the Ispell distribution they are under the Ispell copyright:

 *          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

 *          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

 *          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

 *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

 *   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 *      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO ENTERPRISE 2017, VISUAL STUDIO PROFESSIONAL 2017,
VISUAL STUDIO TEST PROFESSIONAL 2017 AND TRIAL EDITION

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or
based on where you live, one of its affiliates). They apply to the software
named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services and updates for the
software, except to the extent those have different terms.
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT
USE THE SOFTWARE. INSTEAD, RETURN IT TO THE RETAILER FOR A REFUND OR CREDIT. If
you cannot obtain a refund there, contact Microsoft about Microsoft's refund
policies. See www.microsoft.com/worldwide. In the United States and Canada, call
(800) MICROSOFT or see www.microsoft.com/info/nareturns.htm.

TRIAL EDITION USE RIGHTS. If the software is a trial edition, this Section
applies to your use of the trial edition.
A.	GENERAL. You may use any number of copies of the trial edition on your
devices. You may only use the trial edition for internal evaluation
purposes, and only during the trial period. You may not distribute or
deploy any applications you make with the trial edition to a production
environment. You may run load tests of up to 250 virtual users during the
trial period.
B.	TRIAL PERIOD AND CONVERSION. The trial period lasts for 30 days after you
install the trial edition, plus any permitted extension period. After the
expiration of the trial period, the trial edition will stop running. You
may extend the trial period an additional 90 days if you sign in to the
software. You may not be able to access data used with the trial edition
when it stops running. You may convert your trial rights at any time to
the full-use rights described below by acquiring a valid full-use license.
C.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE TRIAL EDITION IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR
THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR
CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT
EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
FOR AUSTRALIA - YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN
CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE
RIGHTS.
E.	SUPPORT. Because the trial edition is "as is," we may not provide support
services for it.
F.	LIMITATIONS ON DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS
ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER
DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the trial version,
services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third
party programs; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the
extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not
apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

FULL-USE LICENSE TERMS FOR THE SOFTWARE: When you acquire a valid license and
either enter a product key or sign in to the software, the terms below apply.
You may not share your product key or access credentials.
1.	OVERVIEW.
a.	Software. The software includes development tools, applications and
documentation.
b.	License Model. The software is licensed on a per user basis.
2.	USE RIGHTS.
a.	General. One user may use copies of the software on your devices to
develop and test applications. This includes using copies of the software
on your own internal servers that remain fully dedicated to your own use.
You may not, however, separate the components of the software and run
those in a production environment, or on third party devices (except as
otherwise stated in this agreement), or for any purpose other than
developing and testing your applications. Running the software on
Microsoft Azure requires a separate license.
b.	Workloads. These license terms apply to your use of the Workloads made
available to you within the software, except to the extent a Workload or a
Workload component comes with different terms.
c.	Demo Use. The use permitted above includes use of the software in
demonstrating your applications.
d.	Backup copy. You may make one backup copy of the software, for
reinstalling the software.
3.	TERMS FOR SPECIFIC COMPONENTS.
a.	Utilities. The software contains items on the Utilities List at
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=823097. You may copy and install
those items, if included with the software, onto your devices to debug and
deploy your applications and databases you developed with the software.
Please note that Utilities are designed for temporary use, that Microsoft
may not be able to patch or update Utilities separately from the rest of
the software, and that some Utilities by their nature may make it possible
for others to access the devices on which they are installed. As a result,
you should delete all Utilities you have installed after you finish
debugging or deploying your applications and databases. Microsoft is not
responsible for any third party use or access of Utilities you install on
any device.
b.	Build Server. The software contains files on the Build Server List at
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=823097. You may copy and install
those Build Server files, if included in the software, onto your build
devices. You and others in your organization may use these files on your
build devices solely to compiling, building and verifying your
applications or running quality or performance tests as part of the build
process.
c.	Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to
display and print content. You may only: (i) embed fonts in content as
permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and (ii) temporarily
download them to a printer or other output device to help print content.
d.	Licenses for Other Components.
*	Microsoft Platforms. The software may include components from Microsoft
Windows; Microsoft Windows Server; Microsoft SQL Server; Microsoft
Exchange; Microsoft Office; and Microsoft SharePoint. These components
are governed by separate agreements and their own product support
policies, as described in the Microsoft "Licenses" folder accompanying
the software, except that, if separate license terms for those
components are included in the associated installation directly, those
license terms control.
*	Developer resources. The software includes compilers, languages,
runtimes, environments, and other resources. These components may be
governed by separate agreements and have their own product support
policies. A list of these other components is located at
https://support.microsoft.com.
*	Third Party Components. The software may include third party components
with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be
described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.
Even if such components are governed by other agreements, the
disclaimers and the limitations on damages below also apply.
The software may also include components licensed under open source
licenses with source code availability obligations. Copies of those
licenses, if applicable, are included in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s).
You may obtain this source code from us, if and as required under the
relevant open source licenses, as set forth in the ThirdPartyNotices
file(s). You may also find a copy of the source code available at
https://thirdpartysource.microsoft.com/.
e.	PACKAGE MANAGERS. The software includes package managers, like NuGet, that
give you the option to download other Microsoft and third party software
packages to use with your application. Those packages are under their own
licenses, and not this agreement. Microsoft does not distribute, license
or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages.
4.	DISTRIBUTABLE CODE. The software contains code that you are permitted to
distribute in applications you develop as described in this Section. (For
this Section the term "distribution" also means deployment of your
applications for third parties to access over the Internet.)
a.	Right to Use and Distribute. The code and text files listed below are
"Distributable Code."
*	REDIST.TXT Files. You may copy and distribute the object code form of
code listed on the REDIST list located at
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=823097.

animations in the Image Library as described in the software
documentation.
*	Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your
applications to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of
those applications.
b.	Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you
must:
*	add significant primary functionality to it in your applications;
*	require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that
protect the Distributable Code at least as much as this agreement; and
*	indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
including attorneys' fees, related to the distribution or use of your
applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely on
the Distributable Code.
c.	Distribution Restrictions. You may not:
*	use Microsoft's trademarks in your applications' names or in a way that
suggests your applications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft; or
*	modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that
any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded
License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or
distribution of code, that (i) it be disclosed or distributed in source
code form; or (ii) others have the right to modify it.
5.	DATA. The software may collect information about you and your use of the
software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to
provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of
many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product
documentation. There are also some features in the software that may enable
you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you
use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing
appropriate notices to users of your applications together with Microsoft's
privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located at
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about
data collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement.
Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.
6.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other
rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation,
you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In
doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software
that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
*	work around any technical limitations in the software;
*	reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise
attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the
extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain
open source components that may be included in the software;
*	remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its
suppliers in the software;
*	use the software in any way that is against the law;
*	share, publish, rent or lease the software, or provide the software as a
stand-alone offering for others to use.
7.	DOCUMENTATION. Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal
network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference
purposes.
8.	NOT FOR RESALE SOFTWARE. You may not sell software marked as "NFR" or "Not
for Resale."
9.	RIGHTS TO USE OTHER VERSIONS AND LOWER EDITIONS. You may use the software
and any prior version on any device. You may create, store, install, run, or
access in place of the version licensed, a copy or instance of a prior
version, different permitted language version, or lower edition.
10.	PROOF OF LICENSE. If you acquired the software on a disc or other media,
your proof of license is the Microsoft certificate of authenticity label,
the accompanying product key, and your receipt. If you purchased an online
copy of the software, your proof of license is the Microsoft product key you
received with your purchase and your receipt and/or being able to access the
software service through your Microsoft account. To identify genuine
Microsoft software, see www.howtotell.com.
11.	TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY. If you are a valid licensee of the software, you
may transfer it and this agreement directly to another party. Before the
transfer, that party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer
and use of the software. The transfer must include the software, genuine
Microsoft product key, and (if applicable) the Proof of License label. The
transferor must uninstall all copies of the software after transferring it
from the device. The transferor may not retain any copies of the genuine
Microsoft product key to be transferred, and may only retain copies of the
software if otherwise licensed to do so. If you have acquired a non-
perpetual license to use the software or if the software is marked Not for
Resale you may not transfer the software or the software license agreement
to another party.
12.	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international
export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include
restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further
information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.
13.	SUPPORT. Microsoft provides support for the software as described at
https://support.microsoft.com.
14.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement (including the warranty below), and the
terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support
services, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
15.	APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington
State law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this
agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other
claims. If you acquire the software in any other country, its laws apply.
16.	CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal
rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws
of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with
Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you
acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if
the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if
you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or if mandatory
country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
a)	Australia. References to "Limited Warranty" mean the express warranty
provided by Microsoft or the manufacturer or installer. This warranty is
in addition to other rights and remedies you may have under law, including
your rights and remedies under the statutory guarantees in the Australian
Consumer Law.
In this section, "goods" refers to the software for which Microsoft or the
manufacturer or installer provides the express warranty. Our goods come
with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law.
You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and
compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are
also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to
be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major
failure.
b)	Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your
device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or
uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also
specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.
c)	Germany and Austria.
(i)	Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially
as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it. However,
Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software.
(ii)	Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross
negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, and death or
personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the
statutory law.
Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for
slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual
obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of
this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this
agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in
(so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence,
Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.
17.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND
ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE
SOFTWARE. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL,
LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the
extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply
to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

*************************************************************************
LIMITED WARRANTY
A.	LIMITED WARRANTY. If you follow the instructions, the software will perform
substantially as described in the Microsoft materials that you receive in or
with the software.
References to "limited warranty" are references to the express warranty
provided by Microsoft. This warranty is given in addition to other rights and
remedies you may have under law, including your rights and remedies in
accordance with the statutory guarantees under local Consumer Law.
B.	TERM OF WARRANTY; WARRANTY RECIPIENT; LENGTH OF ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE
LIMITED WARRANTY COVERS THE SOFTWARE FOR ONE YEAR AFTER ACQUIRED BY THE FIRST
USER. IF YOU RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTS, UPDATES, OR REPLACEMENT SOFTWARE DURING
THAT YEAR, THEY WILL BE COVERED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WARRANTY OR 30 DAYS,
WHICHEVER IS LONGER. If the first user transfers the software, the remainder
of the warranty will apply to the recipient.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR
CONDITIONS LAST ONLY DURING THE TERM OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY. Some states do
not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so these
limitations may not apply to you. They also might not apply to you because
some countries may not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty,
guarantee or condition lasts.
C.	EXCLUSIONS FROM WARRANTY. This warranty does not cover problems caused by
your acts (or failures to act), the acts of others, or events beyond
Microsoft's reasonable control.
D.	REMEDY FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY. MICROSOFT WILL REPAIR OR REPLACE THE SOFTWARE
AT NO CHARGE. IF MICROSOFT CANNOT REPAIR OR REPLACE IT, MICROSOFT WILL REFUND
THE AMOUNT SHOWN ON YOUR RECEIPT FOR THE SOFTWARE. IT WILL ALSO REPAIR OR
REPLACE SUPPLEMENTS, UPDATES AND REPLACEMENT SOFTWARE AT NO CHARGE. IF
MICROSOFT CANNOT REPAIR OR REPLACE THEM, IT WILL REFUND THE AMOUNT YOU PAID
FOR THEM, IF ANY. YOU MUST UNINSTALL THE SOFTWARE AND RETURN ANY MEDIA AND
OTHER ASSOCIATED MATERIALS TO MICROSOFT WITH PROOF OF PURCHASE TO OBTAIN A
REFUND. THESE ARE YOUR ONLY REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY.
E.	CONSUMER RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER
YOUR LOCAL LAWS, WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE.
F.	WARRANTY PROCEDURES. You need proof of purchase for warranty service.
1.	United States and Canada. For warranty service or information about how to
obtain a refund for software acquired in the United States and Canada,
contact Microsoft at:

the Middle East, or Africa, Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited makes
this limited warranty. To make a claim under this warranty, you should

affiliate serving your country (see aka.ms/msoffices).
G.	NO OTHER WARRANTIES. THE LIMITED WARRANTY IS THE ONLY DIRECT WARRANTY FROM
MICROSOFT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO OTHER EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR
CONDITIONS. WHERE ALLOWED BY YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-
INFRINGEMENT. If your local laws give you any implied warranties, guarantees
or conditions, despite this exclusion, your remedies are described in the
Remedy for Breach of Warranty clause above, to the extent permitted by your
local laws.
FOR AUSTRALIA ONLY. References to "Limited Warranty" are references to the
warranty provided by Microsoft. This warranty is given in addition to other
rights and remedies you may have under law, including your rights and
remedies in accordance with the statutory guarantees under the Australian
Consumer Law. Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under
the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for
a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or
damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the
goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a
major failure. Goods presented for repair may be replaced by refurbished
goods of the same type rather than being replaced. Refurbished parts may be
used to repair the goods.
H.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY. THE LIMITATION
ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES CLAUSE ABOVE APPLIES TO BREACHES OF THIS LIMITED
WARRANTY.
THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER
RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH
VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY.
