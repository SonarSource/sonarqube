# IMPORTANT:
# This file will *not* be reloaded when using the api/system/restart endpoint.
# In order for any change made to this file to be taken into account, you must perform a full
# restart of the main SonarQube service.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Property values can:
# - be overridden by environment variables. The name of the corresponding environment variable is the
#   upper-cased name of the property where all the dot ('.') and dash ('-') characters are replaced by
#   underscores ('_'). For example, to override 'sonar.web.systemPasscode' use 'SONAR_WEB_SYSTEMPASSCODE'.
# - be encrypted. See https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/instance-administration/security/#settings-encryption

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DATABASE
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - The embedded H2 database is used by default. It is recommended for tests but not for
#   production use. Supported databases are Oracle, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQLServer.
# - Changes to database connection URL (sonar.jdbc.url) can affect SonarSource licensed products.

# User credentials.
# Permissions to create tables, indices and triggers must be granted to JDBC user.
# The schema must be created first.
#sonar.jdbc.username=
#sonar.jdbc.password=

#----- Embedded Database (default)
# H2 embedded database server listening port, defaults to 9092
#sonar.embeddedDatabase.port=9092


#----- Oracle 19c/21c
# The Oracle JDBC driver must be copied into the directory extensions/jdbc-driver/oracle/.
# Only the thin client is supported, and we recommend using the latest Oracle JDBC driver. See
# https://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/SONAR-9758 for more details.
# If you need to set the schema, please refer to http://jira.sonarsource.com/browse/SONAR-5000
#sonar.jdbc.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521/XE


#----- PostgreSQL 11 or greater
# By default the schema named "public" is used. It can be overridden with the parameter "currentSchema".
#sonar.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/sonarqube?currentSchema=my_schema


#----- Microsoft SQLServer 2014/2016/2017/2019/2022 and SQL Azure
# A database named sonar must exist and its collation must be case-sensitive (CS) and accent-sensitive (AS)
# Use the following connection string if you want to use integrated security with Microsoft Sql Server
# Do not set sonar.jdbc.username or sonar.jdbc.password property if you are using Integrated Security
# For Integrated Security to work, you have to install the Microsoft SQL JDBC Auth package
# Please refer to the online documentation https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube
# for the exact procedure for this version of SonarQube.
#sonar.jdbc.url=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost;databaseName=sonar;integratedSecurity=true

# Use the following connection string if you want to use SQL Auth while connecting to MS Sql Server.
# Set the sonar.jdbc.username and sonar.jdbc.password appropriately.
#sonar.jdbc.url=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost;databaseName=sonar


#----- Connection pool settings
# The maximum number of active connections that can be allocated
# at the same time, or negative for no limit.
# The recommended value is 1.2 * max sizes of HTTP pools. For example if HTTP ports are
# enabled with default sizes (50, see property sonar.web.http.maxThreads)
# then sonar.jdbc.maxActive should be 1.2 * 50 = 60.
#sonar.jdbc.maxActive=60

# The minimum number of connections that can remain idle in the pool,
# without extra ones being created, or zero to create none.
#sonar.jdbc.minIdle=10

# The maximum number of milliseconds that the pool will wait (when there
# are no available connections) for a connection to be returned before
# throwing an exception, or <= 0 to wait indefinitely.
#sonar.jdbc.maxWait=8000

# WEB SERVER
# Web server is executed in a dedicated Java process. By default heap size is @webDefaultHeapSize@.
# Use the following property to customize JVM options.
#    Recommendations:
#
#    The HotSpot Server VM is recommended. The property -server should be added if server mode
#    is not enabled by default on your environment:
#    http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/server-class.html
#
#    Startup can be long if entropy source is short of entropy. Adding
#    -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom is an option to resolve the problem.
#    See https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/HowTo/FasterStartUp#Entropy_Source

# By default, ports will be used on all IP addresses associated with the server.
#sonar.web.host=0.0.0.0

# Web context. When set, it must start with forward slash (for example /sonarqube).
# Changing this value and restarting the server can have unexpected consequences for logged in users,

# cookies and log in again.
# The default value is root context (empty value).
#sonar.web.context=
# TCP port for incoming HTTP connections. Default value is 9000.
#sonar.web.port=9000


# The maximum number of connections that the server will accept and process at any given time.
# When this number has been reached, the server will not accept any more connections until
# the number of connections falls below this value. The operating system may still accept connections
# based on the sonar.web.connections.acceptCount property. The default value is 50.

# The default value is 25.
#sonar.web.http.acceptCount=25

# The number of milliseconds this Connector will wait for another HTTP request before closing the
# connection. The default value is to use the value that has been set for the connectionTimeout 
# attribute. Use a value of -1 to indicate no (i.e. infinite) timeout.
# The default value is 60000 (ms).
#sonar.web.http.keepAliveTimeout=60000

# By default users are logged out and sessions closed when server is restarted.
# If you prefer keeping user sessions open, a secret should be defined. Value is
# HS256 key encoded with base64. It must be unique for each installation of SonarQube.

# Value must be strictly positive.
#sonar.web.sessionTimeoutInMinutes=4320

# A passcode can be defined to access some web services from monitoring
# tools without having to use the credentials of a system administrator.
# Check the Web API documentation to know which web services are supporting this authentication mode.
# The passcode should be provided in HTTP requests with the header "X-Sonar-Passcode".

# LOGGING

# SonarQube produces logs in files located in the same directory (see property sonar.path.logs below),
# one per process:
#   Main process (aka. App) logs in sonar.log
#   Web Server (aka. Web) logs in web.log
#   Compute Engine (aka. CE) logs in ce.log
#   Elasticsearch (aka. ES) logs in es.log
# and two other log files:
#   Access logs
#   Deprecation logs

# Regarding logs for processes:
# Depending on the startup, all 4 files follow the same rolling policy (see sonar.log.rollingPolicy and sonar.log.maxFiles) but it applies
# individually (eg. if sonar.log.maxFiles=4, there can be at most 4 of each files, ie. 16 files in total).
#
# All 4 files have logs in the same format:
#           1           2    3           4                       5                                                   6

# 1: timestamp. Format is YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM:SS
#    YYYY: year on 4 digits
#    MM: month on 2 digits
#    DD: day on 2 digits
#    HH: hour of day on 2 digits in 24 hours format
#    MM: minutes on 2 digits
#    SS: seconds on 2 digits
# 2: log level.
#    Possible values (in order of descending criticality): ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG and TRACE
# 3: process identifier. Possible values: app (main), web (Web Server), ce (Compute Engine) and es (Elasticsearch)
# 4: SQ thread identifier. Can be empty.
#    In the Web Server, if present, it will be the HTTP request ID.
#    In the Compute Engine, if present, it will be the task ID.
# 5: logger name. Usually a class canonical name.
#    Package names are truncated to keep the whole field to 20 characters max
# 6: log payload. Content of this field does not follow any specific format, can vary in length and include line returns.
#    Some logs, however, will follow the convention to provide data in payload in the format " | key=value"
#    Especially, log of profiled pieces of code will end with " | time=XXXXms".

# Global level of logs (applies to all 4 processes).
# Supported values are INFO (default), DEBUG and TRACE
#sonar.log.level=INFO

# Level of logs of each process can be controlled individually with their respective properties.
# When specified, they overwrite the level defined at global level.

# Rolling policy of log files
#    - based on time if value starts with "time:", for example by day ("time:yyyy-MM-dd")
#      or by month ("time:yyyy-MM")
#    - based on size if value starts with "size:", for example "size:10MB"

# Regarding the Access logs:
# Access log is the list of all the HTTP requests received by server. If enabled, it is stored
# in the file {sonar.path.logs}/access.log. This file follows the same rolling policy as other log file
# (see sonar.log.rollingPolicy and sonar.log.maxFiles).
#sonar.web.accessLogs.enable=true

# Format of access log. It is ignored if sonar.web.accessLogs.enable=false. Possible values are:
#    - "common" is the Common Log Format, shortcut to: %h %l %u %user %date "%r" %s %b
#    - "combined" is another format widely recognized, shortcut to: %h %l %u [%t] "%r" %s %b "%i{Referer}" "%i{User-Agent}"
#    - else a custom pattern. See http://logback.qos.ch/manual/layouts.html#AccessPatternLayout.
# The login of authenticated user is not implemented with "%u" but with "%reqAttribute{LOGIN}" (since version 6.1).
# The value displayed for anonymous users is "-".
# The SonarQube's HTTP request ID can be added to the pattern with "%reqAttribute{ID}" (since version 6.2).
# If SonarQube is behind a reverse proxy, then the following value allows to display the correct remote IP address:
#sonar.web.accessLogs.pattern=%i{X-Forwarded-For} %l %u [%t] "%r" %s %b "%i{Referer}" "%i{User-Agent}" "%reqAttribute{ID}"
# Default value (which was "combined" before version 6.2) is equivalent to "combined + SQ HTTP request ID":
#sonar.web.accessLogs.pattern=%h %l %u [%t] "%r" %s %b "%i{Referer}" "%i{User-Agent}" "%reqAttribute{ID}" %D

# Regarding the Deprecation logs:
# Deprecation log is the list of all calls to deprecated Web API.
# It is stored in the file {sonar.path.logs}/deprecation.log. This file follows the same rolling policy as other log file
# (see sonar.log.rollingPolicy and sonar.log.maxFiles).

# Format of deprecation log.
# See https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/instance-administration/server-logs-and-system-info/
