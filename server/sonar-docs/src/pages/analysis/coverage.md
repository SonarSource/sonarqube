This page lists analysis parameters related to test coverage and execution reports. For more other parameters, see [Analysis Parameters](/analysis/analysis-parameters/).

SonarQube doesn't run your tests or generate reports. It only imports pre-generated reports. Below you'll find language- and tool-specific analysis parameters for importing coverage and execution reports.

In the [Guides](https://community.sonarsource.com/c/announce/guides) category of the [SonarSource Community forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/) you might find instructions on generating these reports.

Some properties support the following wildcards in paths. The remarks for properties that support wildcards will mention that fact. If the remarks do not say wildcards are supported, then they are not.:

Symbol|Meaning
---|---
`?`|a single character
`*`|any number of characters
`**`|any number of directories

## Importing .NET reports
To import .NET reports, the report generation process must be executed after the begin step and before the end MSBuild command. The following steps detail importing .NET reports:

1. Run the SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe `begin` command, specifying the absolute path where the reports _will be_ available using the `/d:propertyKey="path"` syntax ("propertyKey" depends on the tool)
1. Build your project using MSBuild
1. Run your test tool, instructing it to produce a report at the same location specified earlier to the MSBuild SonarQube Runner ([How to generate reports with different tools](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-test-data-generate-reports-for-c-vb-net/9871)) 
1. Run the SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe `end` command

For more information, see the [Generate Reports for C#, VB.net Community Post](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-test-data-generate-reports-for-c-vb-net/9871).
