This page lists analysis parameters related to test coverage and execution reports. For more other parameters, see [Analysis Parameters](/analysis/analysis-parameters/).

SonarSource analyzers do not run your tests or generate reports. They only import pre-generated reports. Below you'll find language- and tool-specific analysis parameters for importing coverage and execution reports.  For information on generating reports, see the language-specific information in the analyzers' subdirectories [here](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/PLUG/SonarSource+Plugins).

Some properties support the following wildcards in paths. The remarks for properties that support wildcards will mention that fact. If the remarks do not say wildcards are supported, then they are not.:

Symbol|Meaning
---|---
`?`|a single character
`*`|any number of characters
`**`|any number of directories

**Notes on importing .NET reports**  
.NET reports are imported into SonarQube in 4 steps:

1. Run the SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe `begin` command, specifying the absolute path where the reports _will be_ available using the `/d:propertyKey="path"` syntax ("propertyKey" depends on the tool)
1. Build your project using MSBuild
1. Run your test tool, instructing it to produce a report at the same location specified earlier to the MSBuild SonarQube Runner
1. Run the SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe `end` command
