Test coverage reports and test execution reports are important code quality metrics that you can import into SonarQube. Test coverage reports tell you the percentage of your code that is covered by your test cases. Test execution reports tell you which tests have been run and their results.

[[info]]
| SonarQube doesn't run your tests or generate reports. To include coverage results in your analysis, you need to set up a third-party coverage tool to generate reports and configure SonarQube to import those reports. 

Below you'll find guidelines and resources as well as well as language- and tool-specific analysis parameters for importing coverage and execution reports.

## General Guidlines
Before importing test coverage and execution reports, you need to have the appropriate [SonarScanner](/analysis/overview/) configured as part of your build pipeline. Then, complete the following steps:

1. Set up your coverage tool to run as part of your build pipeline. Your coverage tool should be set up to run *before* the SonarScanner analysis.
1. Configure the coverage tool so that location and format of the output report files matches what the SonarScanner expects.
1. Configure the analysis parameters of the SonarScanner so that it can import the report files.

Now, on each build of your project, your coverage tool performs its analysis and outputs its results to one or more files (usually one for test coverage and one for test execution). Then, the SonarScanner imports those files and sends the results to SonarQube as part of its analysis process.

## Supported report formats
SonarQube supports a variety of formats from third-party tools. We also provide a [generic test data format](/analysis/generic-test/) to easily gather and import test coverage and execution information into SonarQube.

## Language-specific guides
On the [SonarSource Community forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/), you can find guides with instructions on generating reports for the following languages:
* [Apex, C/C++, Objective-C, Go, JS/TS, and Python](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-test-data-generate-reports-for-apex-c-c-objective-c-go-js-ts-and-python/)
* [Swift](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-test-data-generate-reports-for-swift/)
* [C#, VB.net](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-test-data-generate-reports-for-c-vb-net/)
* [JaCoCo](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-test-data-importing-jacoco-coverage-report-in-xml-format/)

## Wildcards
Some analysis parameters support the following path wildcards. Properties that support wildcards are noted in the **Description** columns of the analysis parameter tables below:

## Importing .NET reports
To import .NET reports, the report generation process must be executed after the begin step and before the end MSBuild command. The following steps detail importing .NET reports:

1. Run the SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe `begin` command, specifying the absolute path where the reports _will be_ available using the `/d:propertyKey="path"` syntax ("propertyKey" depends on the tool)
1. Build your project using MSBuild
1. Run your test tool, instructing it to produce a report at the same location specified earlier to the MSBuild SonarQube Runner ([How to generate reports with different tools](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-test-data-generate-reports-for-c-vb-net/9871)) 
1. Run the SonarScanner.MSBuild.exe `end` command

For more information, see the [Generate Reports for C#, VB.net Community Post](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/coverage-test-data-generate-reports-for-c-vb-net/9871).

## Troubleshooting 

### Why doesn't coverage in SonarQube match my coverage tool?
Code coverage metrics may look different between SonarQube and the tool you've used to gather them. Often, this is because the two aren't using the same metrics.  

External tools often use line coverage, calculated by dividing covered lines (lines to cover - uncovered lines) by the total number of executable lines (lines to cover). 

SonarQube uses the covered lines from the imported coverage report and the executable lines (or lines to cover) to calculate its coverage metrics. SonarQube computes coverage as follows:

```
Coverage = (CT + CF + LC)/(2*B + EL)
where
CT = conditions that have been evaluated to â€˜trueâ€™ at least once
CF = conditions that have been evaluated to â€˜falseâ€™ at least once
LC = covered lines = lines_to_cover - uncovered_lines
B = total number of conditions
EL = total number of executable lines (lines_to_cover)
```

SonarQube might also compute line coverage differently from your external tool. This is because the lines to cover may not be the same according to SonarQube and to the tool.

For more information on what SonarQube considers a line of code, see the **Tests** section on the [metric-definitions page](/user-guide/metric-definitions/).
