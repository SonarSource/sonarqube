      <h3>Never Trust User Input</h3>
      <p>
        Applications must treat all user input and, more generally, all third-party data as
        attacker-controlled data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application must determine where the third-party data comes from and treat that data
        source as an attack vector. Two rules apply:
      </p>

      <p>
        First, before using it in the application&apos;s business logic, the application must
        validate the attacker-controlled data against predefined formats, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Character sets</li>
        <li>Sizes</li>
        <li>Types</li>
        <li>Or any strict schema</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Second, the application must sanitize string data before inserting it into interpreted
        contexts (client-side code, file paths, SQL queries). Unsanitized code can corrupt the
        application&apos;s logic.
      </p>
    </>
  );
