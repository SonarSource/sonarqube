    // then hit the browser's Back button, you will get redirected to the login page.

    // ComponentContainer is *updated*. The parent component still has the last component
    // stored in state, the one where the user might not have admin access. It will detect
    // the change in URL and trigger a refresh of its state, but this comes too late; the
    // checkPermission() here will already have triggered (because mounts happen before updates)
    // and redirected the user. Wrapping it in a setTimeout() allows the parent component
    // to refresh, unmounting this component, and only triggering the redirect if it makes sense.
