/**
 * @deprecated Use Button from Echoes instead with the `variety` prop set
 * to ButtonVariety.DefaultGhost to have the same look and feel.
 *
 * Some of the props have changed or been renamed:
 * - `blurAfterClick` is now `shouldBlurAfterClick`
 * - `disabled` is now `isDisabled`, note that a Echoes Tooltip won't work
 * on a disabled button, use a text notice or ToggleTip next to the disabled button instead.
 * - `icon` is now replace by `prefix` which works the same way
 * - `preventDefault` is now `shouldPreventDefault`
 * - `stopPropagation` is now `shouldStopPropagation`
 *
 * The button can't be used as a link anymore, and all props related to links have been dropped.
 * Use a real Echoes Link instead.
 *
 * See the {@link https://xtranet-sonarsource.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Platform/pages/3382706231/Button | Migration Guide} for more information.
