/**
 * The blame strategy defines when the files-blame algorithm is used over jgit or native git algorithm.
 * It has been found that the JGit/Git native algorithm performs better in certain circumstances, such as:
 * - When we have many cores available for multi-threading
 * - The number of files to be blame by the algorithm
 * This two metrics are correlated:
 * - The more threads available, the more it is favorable to use the JGit/Git native algorithm
 * - The more files available, the more it is favorable to use the git-files-blame algorithm
