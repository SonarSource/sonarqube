 * Performs incremental and brute force algorithm in order to filter clones, which are fully covered by other clones.
 * All clones for filtering must be of the same origin - there is no sanity check on this.

 * Godin: This implementation was chosen because it simple.
 * And I wasn't able to find big difference in performance with an interval tree, which we had for the moment of testing.
 * Whereas in fact I expected that interval tree would be better for this task.
 * Moreover with interval tree we also can use incremental approach,
 * but we did not had an implementation with remove operation for the moment of testing.
